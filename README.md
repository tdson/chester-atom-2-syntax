# Chester 2

A syntax highlighting theme for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) whose colours are totally
not ripped off from Lonely Planet's [Rizzo](https://github.com/tdson/chester-atom-2-syntax) styles and what
do you even mean oh no please don't sue me.

There is no the html tag underline.
